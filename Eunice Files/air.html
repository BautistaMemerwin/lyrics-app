<h2>All out of Love</h2>
<main>
    <div clas="lyrics">
        I'm lying alone on my head on the phone<br>
        thinking of you 'til it hurts<br>
        i know you hurt too, but what else can we do<br>
        tormented and torn apart<br>
        I wish i could carry yur smile in my heart<br>
        for times when my life seems slow<br>
        it would make me believe what tommorrow could bring<br>
        when today doesn't really know.<br>
        <br>
        Im out of the love, Im so lost without you<br>
        i know you were right, believing for so long<br>
        im out of love, what am i without you<br>
        i can't be to late to say that i was so wrong<br>
        <br>
        I want you to comeback and scarry me home<br>
        away from these long, lonely nights<br>
        I'm reaching For you. Are you feeling it too?<br>
        does the feeling seem oh, so right?<br>
        <br>
        And what would you say if called on you now<br>
        and said that i can't hold on?<br>
        there's no easy way, it gets harder each day<br>
        please love me or I'll be gone<br>
        <br>
        Im out of the love, Im so lost without you<br>
        i know you were right, believing for so long<br>
        im out of love, what am i without you<br>
        i can't be to late to say that i was so wrong<br>
        <br>
        Oooo.. what are you thinking of<br>
        what are you thinking of<br>
        what are you thinking of<br>
        <br>
        Im out of the love, Im so lost without you<br>
        i know you were right, believing for so long<br>
        im out of love, what am i without you<br>
        i can't be to late to say that i was so wrong<br>
