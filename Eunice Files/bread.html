<h2>Guitar Man</h2>
<main>
    <div clas="lyrics">
        Who draws the crowd<br>
        who plays so loud<br>
        Baby its a guitar man<br>
        Who's going to steal the the show<br>
        You know baby its the guitar man<br>
        <br>
        He can make you love<br>
        He can make you cry<br>
        He will bring you down he'll get you high<br>
        Something keeps him going mile and mile a day<br>
        to find another place to play....<br>
        <br>
        Night after night, who treats you right<br>
        Baby its a guitar man<br>
        Who's on the radio<br>
        You got listen to the guitar mar<br>
        <br>
        And he comes to town and you see his face<br>
        And you think you<br>
        might like to take his place<br>
        Somethings  keeps him going miles and mile a day<br>
        to find another place to play...<br>
        <br>
        Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along<br>
        ou want to get the meaning out of each<br>
        and every song and you find yourself a message and some words<br>
        to call your own and take them home...<br>
        <br>
        Then the lights begin to flicker and the<br>
        sound getting dim<br>
        The voice begins to falter and the crowds getting, thin<br>
        Buts he never seems to notice he's just go to find<br>
        another place to play......<br>
